#Move the Turtlebot3 in a 3D Simulation environment offered by Gazebo:


Make turtlebot move in square/circle gazebo environment :

``roslaunch assignment3 task1.launch code:=circle/square``

https://github.com/Autonomousanz/AuE8230Spring22_SanskrutiJadhav/blob/main/MyWorkspace/src/assignment3/src/videos/Circle_gazebo.mkv

https://github.com/Autonomousanz/AuE8230Spring22_SanskrutiJadhav/blob/main/MyWorkspace/src/assignment3/src/videos/square_gazebo.mkv

Use code:=circle at end of roslaunch command for moving turtlebot in circle of radius 1 unit and 0.5 linear speed

Use code:=square at end of roslaunch command for moving turtlebot in square

To implement emergency braking use following command in Gazebo environment:

``roslaunch assignment3 task2.launch``
